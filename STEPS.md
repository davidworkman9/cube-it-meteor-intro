Today we're going to build a chat application. Complete with seperate chat rooms.

If at any time you have any questions feel free to stop me and I'll try to answer them as best I can.

We're going to start with a boilerplate, first thing I need you to do is open a terminal and run the following:

```
git clone git@github.com:davidworkman9/cube-it-meteor-intro.git
cd cube-it-meteor-intro
meteor
```
